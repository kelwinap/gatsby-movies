Things have changed significantly in Harry's world. With no dark wizards or witches left, the Ministry of Magic's Auror Department shuts down, leaving Harry unemployed. Ginny wants to start a family, Hermione is having doubts about her goody-goody lifestyle, and Ron... well, he's Ron. Everything seems very average in a late-twenties-problem kind of way-- but as always, trouble finds Harry yet again."}}},"pageContext":{"movieId":"393135"}}}
